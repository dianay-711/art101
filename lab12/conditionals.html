		<h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>
			The objective of this lab was to create a function with conditionals with
      my partner.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>
			During Task 3, testing and debugging, I kept getting an error when running
      my code through my console. I went over my code with my partner and we fixed
      any typos or mistakes I may have had. An error continued to come up for me,
      so I then tested my partner's code (which worked for her) and I got the same
      error as a result.
