		<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>
			The objective of this lab was to experiment with basic JavaScript data types
			and vaiables. I created variables based on details about my car, for example
			the make and color.
		</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>
			An issue I had with this lab was  calling the variables in the console.
			I wasn't sure the best format in which to structure them. I got an error the first
			time I tried to call the "make" variable because I initially didn't put them
			in quotes.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
			In the image below, you can see how my page turned out based on the html file
			image you saw above.
