		<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
		<p>The objective of this lab was to continu adding to the file stucture that
			I created in the last lab and add index.html files.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I was pretty straight-forward creating the new files but it did keep getting
		a little mixed up between the Lab 3 HTML file and the overal HTML file. But I
		fixed this by simply renaming my Lab 3 HTML file so that I could easily desifer
		the main file from the rest of the lab files in the future.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>You are currently viewing my index.html file that I created! This is the
		file structure I made:</p>
