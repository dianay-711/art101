      <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>My biggest issue for this lab was getting my output to be displayed the
        way I wanted it to. I tested my code in the console.log and it showed a
        syntax error: Unexpected end of code. I tried figuring out what was going on,
        especially since my partner and I did the same thing, and their code worked. 
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>You can see my results below in the Script Output section :)</p>
