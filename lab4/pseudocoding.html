		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>
			The challenge for this lab was to understand pseudocoding and learn how to excecute it.
			Firstly, we came up with a simple everyday task, making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,
			and wrote out the individual steps. After that, replicated this process but instead we came
			up with a computer task. The computer task was creating a game of Connect 4.

		<p>Pseudocoding an Everyday Task: Making a PB&J</p>
		<pre><code>
			//Gather your ingredients for the sandwich: Bread, Peanut Butter, Jelly
			//Gather materials: knife and plate
			//Pull out two slices of bread and place on the plate.
			//Open the peanut butter and jelly jars.
			//With the knife, spread the peanut butter onto one slice of bread.
			//Again using the knife, spread the jelly onto the other slice of bread.
			//Place the slices with the peanut butter and jelly on top of each other.
			//Place your completed PB&J on the plate and enjoy :)
		</pre></code>
		<p>Pseudocoding a Computer Task: Connect 4</p>
		<pre><code>
			//print the board before each new game
			  //print 7x6 grid
			//accept user input for color of game piece
			  //user input → select ‘Yellow’ or ‘Red’ game piece
			//accept user input for ‘Player 1 move’
			  //user input → Player 1 select a column 1-7 to place selected color piece
			//validate user’s move
			//choose computer move
			  //computer select a column 1-7 to place selected color piece
			//Loop(or Repeat) user input for ‘Player 1 move’ and computer move until either
			//player achieves 4 game pieces in a row
			  //Can be diagonal (- or + slope)
			  //Can be vertical
			  //Can be horizontal
